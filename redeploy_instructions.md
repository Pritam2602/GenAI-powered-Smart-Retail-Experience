# üöÄ Redeploy Instructions - Fix 502 Error

## Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: 502 error and "No price models are loaded" 
- **Cause**: Model files too large for Render free tier
- **Solution**: Added lightweight fallback model and better error handling

## What Was Added
1. **Fallback Model**: Lightweight model that works on Render free tier
2. **Better Error Handling**: More detailed logging for debugging
3. **Multiple Model Fallbacks**: Fast models ‚Üí Original models ‚Üí Fallback model

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Render to Auto-Deploy
Your Render service should automatically redeploy with the new code (takes 2-3 minutes).

### 2. Check Render Logs
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Logs" tab
4. Look for these messages:
   - "Starting model loading process..."
   - "Fallback model loaded successfully"

### 3. Test Your API
Visit: `https://genai-powered-smart-retail-experience.onrender.com/healthz`

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "fast_models_loaded": false,
  "original_model_loaded": true,
  "model_type_in_use": "fallback"
}
```

### 4. Test Your Streamlit App
Your Streamlit app should now work without the 502 error!

## Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ **Price Prediction**: Will work with fallback model
- ‚úÖ **API Health**: Will show as healthy
- ‚ùå **Recommendations**: Still disabled (ChromaDB not available)

## If Still Having Issues
1. Check Render logs for error messages
2. Verify the fallback model is loading
3. Test the API endpoint directly
4. Check Streamlit app logs

The 502 error should be completely resolved now! üéâ
